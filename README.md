MultiverseDB cards JSON data
=========

The goal of this repository is to store card data in a format that can be easily updated by multiple people and their changes reviewed.


## Validating and formatting JSON

Using python >=2.6, type in command line:

```
./validate.py --verbose --fix_formatting
```

The above script requires python package `jsonschema` which can be installed using `pip` via `pip install -U jsonschema`.

You can also just try to follow the style existing files use when editing entries. They are all formatted and checked using the script above.

## Description of properties in schemas

Required properties are in **bold**.

## JSON text editing tips

Full description of (very simple) JSON format can be found [here](http://www.json.org/), below there are a few tips most relevant to editing this repository.

#### Non-ASCII symbols

When symbols outside the regular [ASCII range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart) are needed, UTF-8 symbols come in play. These need to be escaped using `\u<4 letter hexcode>`.

To get the 4-letter hexcode of a UTF-8 symbol (or look up what a particular hexcode represents), you can use a UTF-8 converter, such as [this online tool](http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/utf-8.cgi).

#### Quotes and breaking text into multiple lines

To have text spanning multiple lines, use `\n` to separate them. To have quotes as part of the text, use `\"`.  For example, `"flavor": "\"Winter is Coming.\"\n-Cardinal Durand"` results in following flavor text:

> *"Winter is Coming."*
> 
> *-Cardinal Durand*
